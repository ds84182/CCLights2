CCLights 2 is a Open Source Minecraft mod that adds a Peripheral for ComputerCraft. The GPU Peripheral is capable of rendering draw commands and outputting them to a Monitor, which has a right clickable GUI to use your mouse and keyboard to control actions. This gives a whole new experience for ComputerCraft.

TODO:
-  Make Network code more efficent (Note: This should never be checked off, because the network code always needs to be more efficent)
-  Add border to Monitor GUI (Both Tablet and Regular Monitor)
-  Add texture to external monitors
